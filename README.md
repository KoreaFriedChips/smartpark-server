# SmartPark Server

## Requirements
- Node >= v21.7
- npm >= 10.5
- Wrangler >= 3.41

## Setup
Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.    

Install `wrangler` globally using `npm install -g wrangler`.
Log into your Cloudflare account using `wrangler login`.

In the root directory, create one file: `.env.local`. These
store the environment variables to setup the application.

`.env.local` requires:
- `CLERK_PUBLIC`
    - Available in Notion
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
    - Available in Notion
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
    - Can find this on the Clerk website
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
    - Can find this on the Clerk website

Here's an example `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_XXXXX
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_XXXXX
CLERK_PUBLIC="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nXXXXX\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=XXXX_XXX_X
```

In the root directory, create another file: `.dev.vars`. This
exposes the remaining environment variables.

`.dev.vars` requires:
- `DATABASE_URL`
    - Available in CloudFlare

Here's an example `.dev.vars`:
```
DATABASE_URL="prisma://XXXX"
```
    

## Running
Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client. 

There are two ways to run the server locally. The first way is the simplestâ€”run
`npm run dev`. 

We can create a "mini-flare" setup that emulates a Cloudflare production
environment locally. Using `npm run test` to do that. Make sure you have
`wrangler` installed and logged in. 

**Note**: some libraries will work with `npm run dev` but not `npm run test`,
and vice versa. When adding new libraries, be sure to test with both. 

## Database
We use Prisma as a layer between our application and our database (as of right
now, MongoDB). In order to update the database schema globally, use `npm run
pushschema`. Note: ***under no circumstances should anyone run this command
without explicit permission from all developers. Modifying the schema
serendipidously could break others' development environments and/or the
production environment itself.***

## Deployment
Deployment is automatic on push. Pushing to the master branch deploys directly
to `trysmartpark.com`. Pushing to any other branch also deploys to Cloudflare,
but on a different URL. Refer to the Cloudflare dashboard to find it.
